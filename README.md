### What is it?
An interactive Quiz Web app that users generate, share and save quizzes by utilising a user friendly UI to automatically generate "Make me a quiz with these parameters - " type prompts for OpenAI LLM API to generate a response. The generated quizzes and the corresponding user's performance in answering said questions will be saved to their Google account and will be collected in a prisma serverless relational database.
